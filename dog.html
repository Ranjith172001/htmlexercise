<h2>My dog</h2>

<img src="pdog.png";><p style="margin-left: 204px;margin-top: -157px;">My dog sosha is my best friend. She likes to chose the 
soccer ball when I practice .It is so funny to see her running down the feild trying
to catch the ball with her mouth.It just won't fit!</p>
<div style="margin-top:120px;">
<p>Once Sosha saved my life.When I was 4 years old. I started to go into the street
 to get a ball thet had rooled across the street. Of course I did not think to look forr cars! Shasa got in 
front me and knocked me backwords onto the sidewalk .I was mod umtill I saw the car go by
 where i would heve been .Then i was so happy that was smarter then I was!</p>
